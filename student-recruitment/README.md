# Student Recruitment Analysis

This project aims to analyze the past year's outcomes of students applying to schools and enrolling in schools.

The following were questions analyzed by the exploratory data analysis:

* What percentage of students accepted at their preferred school by applicant tier?
* What percentage of students accepted at a seat at their preferred school once offered?
* What percentage of students accepts seats at schools which are not preferred by their student?
* What do students end up doing when not offered a seat at their preferred school?
* Does distance matter with acceptance?
* What does student attrition look like for students who have accepted a seat?
* Where do we need to focus on student recruitment?
